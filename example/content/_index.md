title: Sapling Example Site
---

Welcome to the example site for Sapling, a simple Hugo theme for hierarchical content. 

## Key features

- Breadcrumb navigation is included on every page.
- Table of contents is included on list pages (ie. those corresponding to directories in your content hierarchy)
- This text is customisable in the`_index.md` of a directory.
- Table of contents is ordered by title, and optionally by weight - both can be specified in the front matter of your content pages.


```swift
// code looks ok too

for i in 1...100 {
    if i % 3 == 0 && i % 5 == 0 {
        print("FizzBuzz")
    } else if i % 3 == 0 {
        print("Fizz")
    } else if i % 5 == 0 {
        print("Buzz")
    } else {
        print(i)
    }
}

```
